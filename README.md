TuneFinder
==========

An attempt to cluster or classify tv shows and movies based on the songs that are played within the course of the episode.
A more ambitious effort would be to try to classify the scenes in which the songs play as well.
This makes us of the TuneFind service which contains the music that is played in every tv show and movie
